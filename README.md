# what is gitlearn?

Gitlearn is an open source [learning management system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) (similar to [ilearn/blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/)).
The distinguishing feature of gitlearn is that classes and grades are stored in git repositories.

## installation

Installing is simple.
Just clone the repo and add the `scripts` folder to your `PATH` using the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikeizbicki/gitlearn
$ export PATH=$(pwd)/scripts:$PATH
```
FIXME: add better install script
